  Big-step, small-step, relational, and functional style operational
  semantics for While in Coq using coinductive traces

description: |-
  Four equivalent coinductive operational semantics in Coq for the While language accounting
  for both terminating and non-terminating program runs through coinductive traces.

  ## Documentation

  - `Trace.v` defines traces and bisimilarity. It proves
    bisimilarity is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
  - `Language.v` defines the While language.
  - `BigRel.v` defines the big-step relational semantics
    and proves that it is deterministic and a setoid predicate.
  - `SmallRel.v` defines the small-step relational semantics
    and proves that it is deterministic and a setoid predicate
    and that the big-step relational and small-step relational
    semantics are equivalent.
  - `BigFunct.v` defines the big-step functional semantics and
    proves that the big-step relational and the big-step functional
    semantics are equivalent.
  - `SmallFunct.v` defines the small-step functional semantics
    and proves that the small-step relational and the small-step
    functional semantics are equivalent and that the small-step
    functional and the big-step functional semantics are equivalent.
  - `Alternatives.v` gives the complete formalizations of the alternative
    big-step semantics considered in the accompanying paper.
